For the Natural Science requirement, if a 0.25-laboratory course accompanies a lecture course, the laboratory course must also be taken and the pair together count as one course towards the two-course requirement (e.g., BIOL130 with BIOL130L). At least one TE, to a maximum of two, must be from another engineering (other than Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering) plan; such courses must have sufficiently advanced engineering science or engineering design content to be allowed, and must be approved by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Undergraduate Office. Exceptions to the requirements and electives listed above require prior approval of the Computer and Electrical Engineering associate chair, undergraduate studies. SpecializationsStudents may choose to focus their elective choices by completing one (or more) of two available specializations.Specializations ListCE-Communications & Signal Processing Specialization, or CE-Quantum Engineering SpecializationOffered by Faculty(ies)Faculty of Engineeringfile_upload","metadata":{"source":"https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/programs/BybwJ10Ri3"}}]
