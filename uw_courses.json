Complete all co-operative education program requirements listed below.  CEAB planner Elective course selections must meet CEAB requirements, including a minimum number of instruction hours in the various CEAB categories. To determine the suitability of elective courses, students should complete the CEAB planner. Two planners must be completed and submitted to the director of biomedical engineering, one planner for approval purposes in the student's 2B or 3A term, and one planner for graduation purposes at the end of the student's 4A term. Students that have combinations of electives that result in a plan that does not meet CEAB criteria will not be permitted to graduate.Co-operative Education Program Requirements  Complete a total of five PD courses: PD11, PD19, PD20, and two additional PD courses.

Only courses from Engineering will contribute towards CEAB hours in the categories of \"Engineering Science\" and \"Engineering Design\". To accommodate an elective reduced load, BME213, BME282, and BME384 may be taken out of sequence. Exceptions to the requirements and electives listed above require prior approval of the director, Biomedical Engineering program. SpecializationsStudents may choose to focus their elective choices by completing one of five available specializations.Specializations ListBiomaterials & Tissues Specialization, Medical Artificial Intelligence Specialization, Medical Devices Specialization, Neural Engineering Specialization, or Sports Engineering SpecializationOffered by Faculty(ies)Faculty of Engineeringfile_upload","metadata":{"source":"https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/programs/HyrkyRRi3"}}]
